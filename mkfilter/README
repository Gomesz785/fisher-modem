- Ported to compile on linux/cygwin
- Cleaned up Makefile system
- Added two new options -R and -A.
  -A lets you to specify alpha*SAMPLERATE instead of alpha so that sample 
  -R lets you specify the sample rate

  This way, the sample rate can be decided at build time instead of having
  to be embedded it in every alpha value specified in a .F file.  All .F 
  files were changed to use -A -R instead of -a, so they specify Hz and 
  not Hz/samplerate.
