<h1> Hardware requirements </h1>

<hr>

If you want to run the code without change, you will need a
<a href=http://www.sgi.com/Products/Indy> Silicon Graphics Indy
workstation. </a> The program is written in C, and could no doubt be ported to
other computers with audio input and output facilities.	 Do not attempt this
unless your computer is <i>fast</i> - an Indy can, for example, compute a
double-precision floating-point arctangent (atan2) in 2.94 us, in which time a
Z80 - to set up a straw man - is within hailing distance of completing a single
16-bit integer addition (ADC) instruction.
<p>
You do <i>not</i> need a fax modem - that would rather defeat the object of the
exercise.  You <i>do</i> need an isolation device which will pass audio signals
unchanged from the 'phone exchange to your Indy and <i>vice versa</i>, and
protect both exchange and Indy from (e.g.) lightning strikes on the 'phone line
or disastrous power supply failures in the Indy.
<p>
In the USA such an isolation device is called a <i>Data Access Arrangement</i>
(DAA), and is available at low cost from (e.g.) <a href=//www.cermetek.com/> Cermetek. </a>
<p>
In the UK things are a little more complicated.	 There is a Post Office
approved device called a <i>Line Terminating Unit</i> (LTU), made by GEC
Plessey around 1980 for the Viewdata trials, which does the job.  A basic LTU
consists of little more than an isolating transformer (price ~&#163;2.50 from RS
or Farnell) and a relay (about the same price, from the same suppliers).  In
the UK an LTU must be approved by BABT before you connect it to a 'phone line -
you'll need one of <a href=sticker.gif> these. </a>
<p>
If you want to see a circuit for a (rather high quality - some might say
over-engineered) LTU, there's a scanned-in image of one <a href=ltu.html>
here. </a>  Sorry about the poor image quality.	 This one was designed for a
student project, to be used on an exchange line simulator, so it doesn't have a
<a href=sticker.gif> you-know-what. </a>
