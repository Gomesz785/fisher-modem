<h1> pstog3, modem - Fax Modem Software </h1>

<hr>

<h2> 1. Introduction </h2>

This is a pair of programs which make an SGI Indy workstation behave like a
fax machine, for transmission of PostScript documents to a remote fax machine.
<p>
The first program, <tt>pstog3</tt>, is a filter which converts a
PostScript file into Group 3 fax format.  The second, <tt>modem</tt>, takes
a document in Group 3 fax format, generates the appropriate tones using the
Indy audio output hardware, and squirts them down the 'phone line through a
PO-approved isolation device.  The result is that the PostScript document
appears on a remote fax machine.
<p>
Full error checking is performed, and you can be confident that a fax has
been delivered if and only if the confirmation message ``Success - delivered
<i>n</i> pages'' is displayed.
<p>
It is not at present possible to <i>receive</i> faxes by these means.  For
this reason, all faxes sent by these programs give the number of the office
fax machine (+44 1904 432767) as the identification of the originating
machine.
<p>
<tt>modem</tt> can also behave as a conventional
(non-fax) modem for interactive use of remote computers over a telephone line.
Both originate and answer modes are supported.

<h2> 2. Examples </h2>

Sending a fax:

<ul>
<tt> $ rlogin indy009				       </tt><br>
<tt> $ cat file.ps | pstog3 | modem -fax +441904432767 </tt><br>
<tt> $ ^D					       </tt><br>
</ul>

Calling the University dial-in modem bank (why?!)

<ul>
<tt> $ rlogin indy009				       </tt><br>
<tt> $ modem -V22o +441904433830		       </tt><br>
<tt> $ ^D					       </tt><br>
</ul>

(The programs <tt>pstog3</tt> and <tt>modem</tt> are in
<tt>/usr/fisher/mipsbin</tt>.)

<h2> 3. The program ``pstog3'' </h2>

This filter converts PostScript into Group 3 fax format, a binary format
understood by all modern fax machines.
The input (on standard input) must be conforming PostScript, possibly
describing a multi-page document.  The output (on standard output)
consists of a header, which contains a ``magic number''
(identifying the format as Group 3) and density information, followed by
concatenated bitmap images of each page.

<h3> 3.1. Usage: </h3>

<ul>
<tt>pstog3 [-{lvn}]</tt>
</ul>

The optional argument <tt>-l</tt> specifies low vertical resolution,
<i>viz.</i> 100 dots per inch (dpi).  The default is 200 dpi.  The lower
resolution is required by some fax machines (see <tt>modem</tt> below).
The horizontal resolution is always 200 dpi.
<p>
The optional argument <tt>-v</tt> specifies ``verbose'' mode: if you give this
option, the program displays the page number of each page as it processes it.
<p>
If <tt>-n</tt> is specified, the header is omitted.  This makes the output
suitable for input to the <tt>pbm</tt> package for further conversion, but
unsuitable for <tt>modem</tt>, since the resolution information, which
<tt>modem</tt> needs, is conveyed in the header.

<h3> 3.2. Diagnostics </h3>

The message ``<tt>GhostScript failed!</tt>'' indicates that the input is not
conforming PostScript.	The most common reasons are (1) it's not any sort of
PostScript - you gave it the wrong sort of file; and (2) it's encapsulated
PostScript, which has had its <tt>showpage</tt>s removed.  If it will print on
a PostScript printer, it ought to be acceptable to <tt>pstog3</tt>.

<h2> 4. The program ``modem'' </h2>

This program emulates a modem.	In the ``fax'' mode, it accepts a Group 3
document from standard input and interacts, via a 'phone line, with a remote
fax machine, causing the document to be printed on the remote machine.	In
the ``modem'' mode, it behaves like a ``terminal emulator'':  it calls a remote
modem (presumably connected to a computer) and then transfers characters from
the keyboard (standard input) to the remote modem, and simultaneously from the
remote modem to the screen (standard output).

<h3> 4.1. Usage: </h3>

<ul>
<tt> modem [-{vmp7}] {-<i>mode</i> | -fax} [-bps <i>bps</i> ...] [+<i>telnum</i> | -ans] </tt><br>
</ul>

<h4> 4.1.1. Modem mode </h4>

<tt>-<i>mode</i></tt> is one of:
<tt>-V21o</tt>, <tt>-V21a</tt>, <tt>-V22o</tt>, <tt>-V22a</tt>, <tt>-V23o</tt> or <tt>-V23a</tt>.
This parameter specifies the transmission standard for an interactive (non-fax) modem session.	The ``a'' variants are
``answer mode'' (used by the modem at the called end of the link) and the ``o'' variants are ``originate mode''
(used by the modem at the calling end).
V.21 is a 300 baud standard, and V.23 is a 1200/75
baud standard, now little used.	 More useful are V.22 (1200 bps full-duplex DPSK)
and V.22 <i>bis</i> (2400 bps [bits per second] full-duplex DPSK), which are selected by the <tt>-V22[oa]</tt> option.	The
program ``handshakes'' with the remote modem, and the <i>bis</i> (2400 bps) variety will be selected if the other modem
can handle it, which is almost always the case.	 To force V.22 (1200 bps) or V.22 <i>bis</i> (2400 bps),
use the <tt>-bps 1200</tt> or <tt>-bps 2400</tt> parameter (respectively) with <tt>-V22[oa]</tt>.
<p>
Faster speeds will probably be available in later versions of the software!

<a href=http://info.itu.ch> ITU's World Wide Web home page. </a>

<h4> 4.1.2. Fax mode </h4>

If you specify <tt>-fax</tt> instead of <tt>-<i>mode</i></tt>, the program
accepts a Group 3 fax document (possibly
multi-page) from standard input and sends it to the specified fax machine.
<p>
A 200 dpi fax takes up to twice as long to send as a 100 dpi one.
Not all fax machines support 200 dpi.  If you see a message

<ul>
<tt>*** Info: Remote fax can't do 200 dpi; try -l </tt>
</ul>

re-create the Group 3 file by running <tt>pstog3</tt>, this time specifying
<tt>-l</tt> on the <tt>pstog3</tt> command line, and re-run the <tt>modem</tt>
command.

<h4> 4.1.3. Other options </h4>

The <tt>-v</tt> option specifies ``verbose'' mode:  if you give this
option, the program displays low-level protocol information as it progresses.
<p>
The <tt>-m</tt> option means ``route via Mercury 131'':	 you will be prompted
for a Mercury PIN, which will not be echoed to the screen, and ``131...'' will be
prefixed to the specified number.
<p>
If you specify <tt>-p</tt>, the call will be logged as ``private'' (rather than
``departmental''):  someone will come chasing you for payment, which ought to be
less than &#163;1 per page!
<p>
<tt>-7</tt> forces 7-bit communication:	 the parity bit will be stripped (set to
zero) in transmissions to and from the remote modem.
<p>
Telephone numbers are given in international form, even for U.K. numbers,
local numbers, and University extensions; see <b>Examples</b> above.  If you specify
<tt>-ans</tt> instead of a telephone number, the modem ``picks up'' the line and gives the
standard V.25 answering sequence, instead of dialing a number.	This option is used on
dial-in modem lines in conjunction with auto-answer (ring-detect) hardware and software.
If you specify <tt>-ans</tt>, you will generally use an ``a'' mode (e.g. <tt>-V22a</tt>);
If you specify a telephone number, you will generally use an ``o'' mode (e.g. <tt>-V22o</tt>).

<h3> 4.2. Diagnostics </h3>

Messages of the form

<ul>
<tt>*** Info:</tt> ...
</ul>

give you information; they are not error messages, even dire-sounding ones like

<ul>
<tt>*** Info: Checksum error</tt>
</ul>

Messages of the form

<ul>
<tt>*** Error:</tt>  ...
</ul>

indicate that something has gone wrong, and the document could not be
delivered.  If you see:

<ul>
<tt> *** Info: Success - delivered <i>n</i> pages </tt>
</ul>

you can be confident that the document has been delivered successfully and in
its entirety.

<h3> 4.3. Bugs </h3>

The program has been tested on only a small number of fax machines.  It ought
to work with all modern, fast machines; older machines might use an older
version of the protocol, in which case you might see the message

<ul>
<tt> *** Error: Remote fax can't do V.29 </tt>
</ul>

There might possibly be problems sending to faxes which are answered manually,
or which share a line with a telephone or an answering machine:	 fax switches
are notoriously temperamental.
<p>
Note that V.27<i>ter</i> is not implemented.  This is an older, slower
standard than V.29.  Despite being older and slower, it's more complicated to
implement.
<p>
The ITU standards documents are no longer free.

<h2> 5. Resource implications </h2>

<tt>modem</tt> will of course only work on an Indy which has a suitable
approved connection to a 'phone line.  For the present, that means indy009
(which is mine).  All usage of <tt>modem</tt> is logged; the Mercury PIN
however is not stored in the log file - you'll have to take my word for that.
The only cost involved, in realistic terms (e.g. neglecting the cost of
electricity to run the hardware), is the cost of the 'phone call.  I suppose a
realistic <i>modus operandi</i> for potential users is to restrict their use
to departmental business only, unless the <tt>-m</tt> or <tt>-p</tt> switch
is used. <p>

My 'phone can't make international calls, so your faxes are restricted, for the
moment, to destinations in the U.K.  If you have a personal Mercury 131 account,
however, you can send personal faxes anywhere, at any time. <p>
