KNOWN BUGS
	Do proper newlines after hayes commands
        Fix stdinexception when /dev/ttyz0 is disconnected

INVESTIGATION
	my_alarm commented out but need to replace with something else
	rateword needs to be copied and reset after each use

GENERAL
	don't use exceptions, is slower in c++ to try/catch
	get rid of virtual function calls for high volume loops?(get/put byte)
	make sure all global veriables are removed
	add sample in recorder and playback ability
	move v8 back into v8rx/tx classes to keep Modem cleaner
	move tx/rxloop back into v21rx/tx classes to keep Modem cleaner
	abort connect/answer or handshake on any character press during
	remove args and use hayes to control v21/v23/v32/v34 etc
        Find out why the bluetooth stack doesn't block!  Get rid of the
        fake throttle if possible.

HAYES

    ATMn - nothing for software modem
    ATLn - nothing for software modem
    A/ - repeat last
    ATIn
    ATZn - reset to profile n
    AT&Fn - factory reset
    AT&Jn - noop
    AT&V - view config
    AT&Wn
    AT&Yn
    AT&Zn=x
    ATS0=1
    AT+MS=x,x

    Registers To Add:
	pulse tone length ms
	pulse tone dialing delay ms
	audible bell yes/no
	look at other real modem registers

Notes to self:

Terminal: input runner thread
	blocking read from stdin (1 sec timeout for stop check)
	produces into intermediate character buffer

Terminal: output runner thread
	blocks on empty intermediate character buffer
	if not empty, writes to stdout

Modem: txloop thread
	blocking read on intermediate sample buffer (if not full yet)
	put char to intermediate char buffer

Modem: rxloop thread
	read from intermediate char buffer 
	put char to intermediate sample buffer (blocks if full)

SampleDevice: inputrunner thread
	blocking read on device
	writes to intermediate sample buffer (double buffer)

SampleDevice: outputrunner thread
	read from intermediate sample buffer (double buffer)
	blocking write to device (double buffer)

If a device doesn't actually block on read/write, we fake it using usleep.
